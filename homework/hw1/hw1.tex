\section*{(1)} \textit{Suppose you encrypt a text using an affine cipher, then encrypt the encryption using another affine cipher (both are working $\mod{26}$). Is there any advantage to doing this, rather than using a single affine cipher? Why or why not?}

\begin{defn}
Let $\alpha , \beta \in \mathbb Z$ with $\gcd(\alpha , 26) = 1$. The function $E(m) = \alpha m_i + \beta \pmod{26}$ is called an affine cipher.
\end{defn}

Suppose $E(m) = (F \circ G)(m)$, where $F(m) = am_i + b$ and $G(m) = cm_i + d$ are both affine ciphers $\pmod{26}$. Then

\begin{align*}
    E(m) &= F(G(m))\\
         &= a(cm_i + d) + b \pmod{26}\\
         &= acm_i + ad + b \pmod{26}\\
         &= pm_i + q \pmod{26}\\
\end{align*}

where $p = ac \pmod{26}$ and $q = ad + b \pmod{26}$, which is no different than a single affine cipher. The difficulty of cracking this cipher remains unchanged.

\section*{(2)} \textit{Suppose we work $\mod{27}$ instead of $\mod{26}$ for affine ciphers. How many keys are possible? What if we work $\mod{29}$?}

The following numbers are those relatively prime with 26, 27, and 29.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\pmod{26}$:]
  \texttt{[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25]}
  \item[$\pmod{27}$:]
  \texttt{[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26]}
  \item[$\pmod{29}$:]
  \texttt{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]}
\end{itemize}
There are 12 numbers relatively prime with 26, 18 with 27, and 28 with 29. In general, if there are $m$ numbers relatively prime with $n$, then there are $n\cdot m$ key possibilities for an affine cipher.

The following are the number of key possibilities for 26, 27, and 29.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\pmod{26}$:] 312 key possibilities
  \item[$\pmod{27}$:] 486 key possibilities
  \item[$\pmod{29}$:] 812 key possibilities
\end{itemize}

\section*{(3)} \textit{Eve captures Bobâ€™s Hill cipher machine, which uses a $2\times2$ matrix $M \mod{26}$. She tries a chosen plaintext attack. She finds that the plaintext $ba$ encrypts to $HC$ and the plaintext $zz$ encrypts to $GT$. What is the matrix $M$.}

Solve the matrix equation

$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\25 & 25\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix} \equiv \begin{pmatrix}7 & 2\\6 & 19\end{pmatrix} \pmod{26}$$

Note that oddly enough, $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\25 & 25\end{pmatrix}$ is its own modular inverse. So, we have

$$M = \begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\25 & 25\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}7 & 2\\6 & 19\end{pmatrix} \pmod{26} = \begin{pmatrix}7 & 2\\12 & 5\end{pmatrix}$$

\section*{(4)} \textit{A sequence generated by a length three recurrence starts $001110$. Find the next four elements of the sequence.}

\section*{(5)} \textit{Experiment with the affine cipher $y = m x + n \pmod{26}$ for values of $m > 26$. In particular, determine whether or not these encryptions are the same as ones obtained with $m < 26$.}

\section*{(6)} \textit{The following sequence was generated by a linear feedback shift register. Determine the recurrence that generated it.}

\texttt{[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1,
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0,
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}

\textit{You also believe that the first two letters of the plaintext are $if$. Decrypt.}
