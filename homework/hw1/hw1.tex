\section*{(1)} Suppose you encrypt a text using an affine cipher, then encrypt the encryption using
another affine cipher (both are working $\mod{26}$). Is there any advantage to doing this,
rather than using a single affine cipher? Why or why not?

\begin{defn}
Let $\alpha , \beta \in \mathbb Z$ with $\gcd(\alpha , 26) = 1$. The function $E(m) = \alpha m_i + \beta \pmod{26}$ is called an affine cipher.
\end{defn}

Suppose $E(m) = (F \circ G)(m)$, where $F(m) = am_i + b$ and $G(m) = cm_i + d$ are both affine ciphers $\pmod{26}$. Then

\begin{align*}
    E(m) &= F(G(m))\\
         &= a(cm_i + d) + b \pmod{26}\\
         &= acm_i + ad + b \pmod{26}\\
         &= pm_i + q \pmod{26}\\
\end{align*}

where $p = ac \pmod{26}$ and $q = ad + b \pmod{26}$, which is no different than a single affine cipher. The difficulty of cracking this cipher remains unchanged.

\section*{(2)} Suppose we work $\mod{27}$ instead of $\mod{26}$ for affine ciphers. How many keys are
possible? What if we work $\mod{29}$?

\section*{(3)} Eve captures Bobâ€™s Hill cipher machine, which uses a $2\times2$ matrix $M \mod{26}$. She tries a chosen plaintext attack. She finds that the plaintext $ba$ encrypts to $HC$ and the plaintext $zz$ encrypts to $GT$. What is the matrix $M$.

\section*{(4)} A sequence generated by a length three recurrence starts $001110$. Find the next four
elements of the sequence.

\section*{(5)} Experiment with the affine cipher $y = m x + n \pmod{26}$ for values of $m > 26$. In particular, determine whether or not these encryptions are the same as ones obtained with $m < 26$.

\section*{(6)} The following sequence was generated by a linear feedback shift register. Determine the recurrence that generated it.

\texttt{[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1,
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0,
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}

\section*{(7)} You have caught the following ciphertext, and you believe it was encrypted by an affine cipher:

You also believe that the first two letters of the plaintext are $if$. Decrypt.
